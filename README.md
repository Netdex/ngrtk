# ngrtk
`This project is a work-in-progress.`

This project is a spiritual successor to [DOSVideoPlayer](https://github.com/Netdex/DOSVideoPlayer).

**ngrtk** is a [demo scene](https://www.pouet.net/faq.php) recreating the 
[Bad Apple!!](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm8628149) shadow art PV on an i586 compatible system. 
Done completely for fun and for the sake of a technical challenge.
